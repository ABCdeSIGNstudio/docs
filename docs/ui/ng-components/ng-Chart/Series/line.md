# RadChart Line Series
{% typedoc_link classes:LineSeries %} are categorical type of series that represent the objects from the data source as dots connected with a line. To use Line series, you need to initialize a {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChart %}, define a {% typedoc_link classes:CategoricalAxis %} and {% typedoc_link classes:LinearAxis %} and bind the series to a set of data objects.

#### Example
Just like with all angular 'pages' let's start with the `Component` in which we will place our {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChart %} instance. We create a basic angular `Component` that contains a collection of objects provided by an custom service, which will be used by the chart to provide intuitive data visualization.

The service is a simple 'mock' of an backend call that will return an array of objects:

<snippet id='chart-angular-data-service'/>

Inside that service we have a single function which returns an array:

<snippet id='chart-angular-categorical-source'/>

<snippet id='chart-angular-country'/>

All that is left is to declare the template of the angular component in which we:

- Declare a {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChart %}
- Declare the {% typedoc_link classes:CategoricalAxis %} and {% typedoc_link classes:LinearAxis %} between the {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChart %} open and close tags
- After that set the **`tkCartesianHorizontalAxis`** and **`tkCartesianVerticalAxis`** directive to the axes
- Finally declare a {% typedoc_link classes:LineSeries %} instance to it, bind the {% typedoc_link classes:LineSeries,member:items%} to the source of data and set the **`tkCartesianSeries`** directive

<snippet id='chart-angular-line-series'/>

Here's how your Line chart should look like:
