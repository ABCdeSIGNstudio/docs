# RadChart Area Series
Area series work pretty much the same way as Line series with the only difference that the area between the categorical axis and the data points is filled with the corresponding color of the line. To use Area series, you need to initialize a {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChart %}, define a {% typedoc_link classes:CategoricalAxis %} and {% typedoc_link classes:LinearAxis %} and bind the series to a set of data objects.

#### Example
Just like with all angular 'pages' let's start with the `Component` in which we will place our {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChart %} instance. We create a basic angular `Component` that contains a collection of objects provided by an custom service, which will be used by the chart to provide intuitive data visualization.

The service is a simple 'mock' of an backend call that will return an array of objects:

<snippet id='chart-angular-data-service'/>

Inside that service we have a single function which returns an array:

<snippet id='chart-angular-categorical-source'/>

<snippet id='chart-angular-country'/>

All that is left is to declare the template of the angular component in which we:

- Declare a {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChart %}
- Declare the {% typedoc_link classes:CategoricalAxis %} and {% typedoc_link classes:LinearAxis %} between the {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChart %} open and close tags
- After that set the **`tkCartesianHorizontalAxis`** and **`tkCartesianVerticalAxis`** directive to the axes
- Declare a {% typedoc_link classes:AreaSeries %} instance to it, bind the {% typedoc_link classes:AreaSeries,member:items%} to the source of data and set the **`tkCartesianSeries`** directive

<snippet id='chart-angular-area-series-component'/>
<snippet id='chart-angular-area-series'/>

The final result is shown in the two images (android and ios) below.
