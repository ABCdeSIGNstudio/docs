# RadChart LinearAxis

{% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChart %} requires an axis that can represent the values of the data points. The {% typedoc_link classes:LinearAxis %} plots the associated data points using each point's actual value, provided for the axis. The axis works with categorical data and uses the Value property of each CategoricalDataPoint that needs to be plotted. It will build a numerical range (user-defined or automatically calculated) and will determine each data point X or Y coordinate (depending on whether the axis is specified as Horizontal or as Vertical).
