# RadChart CategoricalAxis

When [RadCartesianChart]({% slug chart-types-cartesian-angular %} "Read more about RadCartesianChart") visualizes {% typedoc_link classes:CategoricalSeries %}, it needs an axis that can represent the different categories. The {% typedoc_link classes:CategoricalAxis%} is used to displays a range of categories. Categories are built depending on the **Category** value of each **CategoricalDataPoint** present in the owning **CategoricalSeries** chart series. The axis is divided into discrete slots and each data point is visualized in the slot corresponding to its categorical value.

The next example demonstrates how to use {% typedoc_link classes:CategoricalSeries %} with {% typedoc_link classes:BarSeries %}. We first create a basic angular `Component` that contains a collection of objects provided by an custom service, which will be used by the chart to provide intuitive data visualization.

The service is a simple 'mock' of an backend call that will return an array of objects:

<snippet id='chart-angular-data-service'/>

Inside that service we have a single function which returns an array:

<snippet id='chart-angular-categorical-source'/>

<snippet id='chart-angular-country'/>

All that is left is to declare the template of the angular component in which we:

- Declare a {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChart %}
- Declare the {% typedoc_link classes:CategoricalAxis %} and {% typedoc_link classes:LinearAxis %} between the {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChart %} open and close tags
- After that set the **`tkCartesianHorizontalAxis`** and **`tkCartesianVerticalAxis`** directive to the axes
- Finally declare a {% typedoc_link classes:BarSeries %} instance to it, bind the {% typedoc_link classes:BarSeries,member:items%} to the source of data and set the **`tkCartesianSeries`** directive

## Features

### Plot Mode

The {% typedoc_link classes:CategoricalAxis %} allows you to define how exactly the axis will be plotted on the viewport of the chart. The possible values are:

* {% typedoc_link enums:ChartAxisPlotMode,member:BetweenTicks%}: Points are plotted in the middle of the range, defined between each two ticks.
* {% typedoc_link enums:ChartAxisPlotMode,member:OnTicks%}: Points are plotted over each tick.

You can get and set the current value with the {% typedoc_link classes:CategoricalAxis,member:plotMode%} property.

### Major Tick Interval

Defines the step at which major ticks are generated. This property also affects axis labels as they are generated on a per major tick basis. You can get or set the value with the **majorTickInterval** property. For example, if you don't want to display all ticks, but instead only half of them (display the first, third, fifth, etc. ticks), you should set the major tick interval to 2.

This is how the axis in this example looks like:
