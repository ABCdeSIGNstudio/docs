# RadChart Pie series
Unlike all other series, {% typedoc_link classes:PieSeries %} do not require axes. They visualize each data point as pie slices with arc size directly proportional to the magnitude of the raw data point's value. Pie slices represent data in one direction contrasting with the other series which represent data in two dimensions.

## Example
The following definition represents the data context that will be used to populate our Pie series with data:

<snippet id='categorical-source'/>

We use an instance of this model to assign it as the `bindingContext` of the page we have put our Pie series on:

<snippet id='binding-context-pie-series'/>

And finally, in the XML definition of the page we put two RadCartesianCharts, add a PieSeries instance to one of them and DonutSeries to the other and bind the series to the source of data.

<snippet id='pie-series'/>

This is how the example looks like:
![Cartesian chart: Pie series](../../../img/ns_ui/pie_series_android.png "Pie series on Android.") ![Cartesian chart: Pie series](../../../img/ns_ui/pie_series_ios.png "Pie series on iOS.")
