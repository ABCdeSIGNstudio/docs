# RadChart Spline Area Series
{% typedoc_link classes:SplineAreaSeries %} are categorical type of series that visualize the data objects as a series of dots connected with a spline, i.e. a curved line segments. Additionally, the area between the X-axis and the spline is filled with a specific color - hence the Spline Area name. To use Spline Area series, you need to initialize a {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChart %}, define a {% typedoc_link classes:CategoricalAxis %} and {% typedoc_link classes:LinearAxis %} and bind the series to a set of data objects.

## Example
The following definition represents the data context that will be used to populate the Spline Area series with data:

<snippet id='categorical-source-ts'/>

We use an instance of this model to assign it as the `bindingContext` of the page we have put our Spline Area series on:

<snippet id='spline-area-series-binding-context'/>

And finally, in the XML definition of the page we put a {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChart %}, add a {% typedoc_link classes:SplineAreaSeries %} instance to it and bind the series to the source of data:

<snippet id='spline-area-series-xml'/>
